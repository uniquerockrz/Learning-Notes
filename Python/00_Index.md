# Python

Python is a high level programming language that is both easy to use and powerful. I have added my python notes in this folder, and some resources in the end. 

## Table Of Contents

## TODO

* More details are needed about frequently used python methods, such as `emunerate`
* More topics such as operator overloading, modules, packages etc.
